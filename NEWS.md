## Development

Fixes:
  * Fix crash if `process_mr()` is run without any SMR method requested.
  * Export epoc functions.

Enhancements:
  * Improve column names on output of `extract_epoc()`.
  * New `calc_single_slope()` function.

## pyroresp 0.1.0

This is the version that was used for the first publication ([D'Souza, Fl√°vio and Wilkie, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102536)). It has many upgrades over the older code, as I had to apply many changes to obtain data required by reviewers. I won't list them all here; the package is not big enough to warrant that yet.

## pyroresp 0.0.3

Changes:
  * Code overhaul. Most functions and variables changed. Very likely to have
  a few bugs lurking around still.
  * New logo.
  * Implementing github actions.
  * New workflow vignette.


## Forked version 0.0.1

Note:
  * This package is forked from FishResp!
